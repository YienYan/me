怎样设置txt文本 
I learned how to create a txt through use python.

 'open()': read file content
 'json.loads()' : convert a JSON string into a Python dictionary and parse JSON responses
 'requests.get()': send HTTP requests
 'response.status_code': check if the request was successful
 'response.text': get the response content
 'readlines()': read file content line by line
 'count()': count occurrences of a substring
 'with open()' and 'write()' write results to a file.
 '__name__ == "__main__"' check if the script is run as the main program.
 'print()' to output results.
 'os.path.isfile()' check if files exist

 This is the first time I've realized that code interacts with other files. I feel it's getting harder and harder, and I don't even understand the requirements of the last piece of code in part 1. I thought it was about putting this file into Grasshopper to have the model laser cut, but later I found out that it was actually about counting how many times the word "laser" appears in the last text file of set4.
