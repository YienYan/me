In "loops_preview' and "loops_1a" & "loops_2_preview" I learned to use "for" loop to iterate over a range, "list.append()" method to add items to a list.

In "loops_1c" I learned to use function arguments to pass variables and generate a list based on those arguments.

In "loops_2" and "loop_5" i learned ues list multiplication to create lists with repeated elements and use nested 'for' loops to generate a 2D list.

In "loops_3" i learned to use the 'range()' function to generate a sequence of numbers and convert numbers to strings and using list multiplication to create lists with repeated elements.

In "loop_4" i learned to use list comprehensions to generate lists with consecutive numbers.

All in all, I feel that my understanding of loops is still not proficient enough, and I am not able to write a complete piece of code independently.
