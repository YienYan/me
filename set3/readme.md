TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
python3 ../course/set3/tests.py
In "loop_ranger" & "two_step_ranger" I learned to use a 'while' loop to iterate until a condition is met and Initialize a variable ('current') and updating it within the loop and append values to a list using 'list.append()'.

In "stubborn_asker" I learned to use an infinite 'while' loop to repeatedly ask for user input and use 'try...except' to handle invalid input and ensure the input is an integer and chevk if the input is within the specified range and repeating the request if it is not.

In "not_number_rejector' I learned to use 'try...except' to repeatedly prompt the user until a valid number is entered.

In 'supper_asker' I learned to Combine the logic from 'stubborn_asker' and 'not_number_rejector' to create a more robust input validation function and use a 'try-except' block for error handling and a 'while True' loop for continuous prompting until valid input is received.

Loops: Using 'while' loops to repeat a block of code until a specific condition is met.
List Operations: Using list methods like 'append()' to build lists.
Input and Output: Using 'input()' to get user input and 'print()' to display messages.
Error Handling: Using 'try-except' blocks to handle exceptions and ensure the program continues to run smoothly.
Type Conversion: Using functions like 'int()' to convert input to the desired type.

I think set3 is much more complex than set2 and includes a lot of new concepts. Therefore, at the beginning, I really didn't know how to write code that could run successfully. I still don't quite understand when to use underscores to connect consecutive words and when to just capitalize the first letter.
